    "Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are used to store data values that can be accessed and manipulated throughout the program. A variable is like a container that holds a value, and its content can change during the execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a variable in Python, you simply choose a name for the variable and assign a value to it using the assignment operator (`=`). Here's the basic syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "variable_name = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's declare a variable named `message` and assign the string value `\"Hello, World!\"` to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "message = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the variable `message` is created and assigned the value `\"Hello, World!\"`. Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to explicitly specify the variable's type. The type is inferred based on the value assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also assign different types of values to a variable. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 10  # integer\n",
    "y = 3.14  # float\n",
    "is_valid = True  # boolean\n",
    "name = \"John\"  # string\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a wide range of data types, including integers, floats, booleans, strings, lists, dictionaries, and more. The type of a variable can change dynamically as you assign different values to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables in Python are case-sensitive, so `message` and `Message` would be considered different variables. It's good practice to choose meaningful and descriptive names for your variables to enhance code readability and understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a variable is declared and assigned a value, you can use its name throughout the program to access or modify the stored value. For example, you can print the value of a variable using the `print()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(message)  # Output: Hello, World!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also perform operations and calculations with variables, reassign them with new values, or use them in various other ways to manipulate data in your program."

    "In mathematics, a complex number is a number of the form `a + bi`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers and `i` represents the imaginary unit. The imaginary unit `i` is defined as the square root of -1. Complex numbers consist of a real part (`a`) and an imaginary part (`b`), and they are often used to represent quantities involving both real and imaginary components.\n",
