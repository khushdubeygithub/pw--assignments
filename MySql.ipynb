    "A database is a structured collection of data organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, manipulation, and management of the data. It provides a mechanism for storing, managing, and accessing large amounts of information reliably and securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems (DBMS) that have distinct characteristics and are used for different purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL Databases (Relational Databases):\n",
    "   SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are based on a relational model, where data is organized into tables with predefined schemas consisting of rows and columns. These databases use SQL as their standard language for querying and manipulating data. Some popular SQL database systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Key characteristics of SQL databases:\n",
    "   - Data is stored in predefined schemas with a fixed structure.\n",
    "   - Tables have well-defined relationships with primary and foreign keys.\n",
    "   - SQL is used to perform queries and operations on the data.\n",
    "   - Transactions support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "   - Suitable for complex queries and applications requiring strong consistency and structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational Databases):\n",
    "   NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, and rapidly changing data. They provide a flexible schema that allows for dynamic and scalable storage of data. NoSQL databases use various data models, including key-value, document, columnar, and graph. Some popular NoSQL database systems include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Key characteristics of NoSQL databases:\n",
    "   - Schema-less or flexible schema allows for storing different types of data without predefined structures.\n",
    "   - Horizontal scalability, enabling distributed storage across multiple servers.\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases use query languages specific to their data models, such as MongoDB's query language.\n",
    "   - No strict transactions or ACID guarantees, but they provide high availability and partition tolerance (AP) in distributed environments.\n",
    "   - Suitable for handling large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data and highly scalable applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on various factors, including the nature of the data, scalability requirements, performance needs, development flexibility, and the specific use case of the application. Each type of database has its strengths and weaknesses, so it's essential to consider these factors when deciding which one to use."

    "The most commonly used DQL statement is the SELECT statement, which retrieves data from one or more tables in a database. Here's an explanation of the SELECT statement with an example:\n",

    "\n",

    "- `WHERE condition` (optional) specifies the condition(s) that the retrieved data must meet. It allows you to filter the data based on specific criteria.\n",
    "- `ORDER BY column` (optional) allows you to sort the retrieved data in ascending or descending order based on a specified column.\n",

    "Example:\n",

    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Age > 30\n",
    "ORDER BY Salary DESC;\n",
    "```\n",

    "This SELECT statement retrieves the \"Name\" and \"Salary\" columns from the \"Employees\" table where the \"Age\" is greater than 30. The retrieved data is then sorted in descending order of the \"Salary\" column.\n",

    "The result of the SELECT statement will be a set of rows that match the specified conditions, containing the selected columns' values. In this example, it will return the names and salaries of employees who are older than 30, sorted by their salaries in descending order.\n",

    "A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that uniquely identifies each record in that table. It serves as a unique identifier for each row and ensures the integrity and uniqueness of the data within the table. Some key points about primary keys are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique. No two rows in the table can have the same value in the primary key column(s).\n",
    "2. Non-nullability: Primary key columns cannot contain null values. They must have a value for every record.\n",
    "3. Single Value: A primary key can consist of a single column or a combination of multiple columns, forming a composite key.\n",
    "4. Indexing: By default, a primary key is indexed, which facilitates faster data retrieval and enforces the uniqueness constraint.\n",
    "5. Relationship Establishment: Primary keys are often used to establish relationships with other tables using foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a database table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, representing a link or dependency between them. Foreign keys maintain referential integrity, ensuring that the values in the foreign key column(s) match the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table. Key points about foreign keys are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Referential Integrity: A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, enforcing referential integrity. It ensures that the values in the foreign key column(s) correspond to existing values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table.\n",
    "2. Relationship Types: Foreign keys can represent different types of relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, between tables.\n",
    "3. Cascading Actions: Foreign keys can have cascading actions associated with them, specifying what happens when a referenced row is updated or deleted. Common actions include cascading updates or deletes, setting null values, or restricting the operation.\n",
    "4. Indexing: While not mandatory, foreign keys are often indexed to improve the performance of joins and queries involving the foreign key column(s).\n",
    "5. Multiple Foreign Keys: A table can have multiple foreign keys, referencing different tables or even the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key uniquely identifies records in a table, ensuring their uniqueness and integrity. A foreign key establishes a relationship between tables, referring to the primary key of another table and maintaining referential integrity. Together, primary and foreign keys play a crucial role in defining relationships and maintaining data consistency in a relational database."

    "\n",
    "Explanation of cursor() and execute() methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `cursor()` Method:\n",
    "   - The `cursor()` method creates a cursor object that allows you to interact with the database.\n",
    "   - It is called on the established connection object (`conn.cursor()` in the example) and returns a cursor.\n",
    "   - The cursor serves as a handle or context for executing SQL queries and managing the result set.\n",
    "   - The cursor object provides various methods, such as `execute()`, to perform database operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `execute()` Method:\n",
    "   - The `execute()` method is used to execute an SQL query or statement.\n",
    "   - It is called on the cursor object and takes the SQL query as a parameter.\n",
    "   - The SQL query can be a SELECT statement, an INSERT statement, an UPDATE statement, or any other valid SQL statement.\n",
    "   - The `execute()` method sends the query to the MySQL server for execution.\n",
    "   - In the case of a SELECT query, it retrieves the result set from the server.\n",
    "   - For other queries, it performs the corresponding operation on the database.\n",
    "   - Any placeholders in the SQL query can be filled using parameters provided as a tuple or dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example code, the `execute()` method is used to execute the SELECT query `\"SELECT * FROM your_table\"`. It retrieves all rows from the specified table. The fetched result is then printed using a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing the query and fetching the result, it is good practice to close the cursor and connection to free up resources and maintain proper cleanup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to replace the placeholders (`your_username`, `your_password`, `your_database`, `your_table`) in the code with the appropriate values specific to your MySQL setup and database structure."
