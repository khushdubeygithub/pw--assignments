    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional condition arises, an exception object is created and the normal flow of the program is interrupted. The exception is then propagated up the call stack until it is handled by an exception handler or until it reaches the top level of the program, causing the program to terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions are used to handle errors or exceptional conditions that may occur during the execution of a program. They allow you to gracefully handle and recover from errors, rather than abruptly terminating the program. Exceptions provide a way to separate the error-handling code from the normal code, making the program more robust and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that violates the language's grammar rules. These errors are typically caused by mistakes in the code's syntax, such as misspelled keywords, missing or misplaced punctuation, or incorrect indentation. Syntax errors prevent the program from being executed at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is executed. Exceptions are a result of runtime errors or exceptional conditions that occur while the program is running, such as division by zero, accessing a non-existent file, or trying to access an invalid index in a list. Syntax errors, on the other hand, are caused by mistakes in the code's syntax and can be identified by the interpreter during the parsing phase, before the program starts executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are runtime errors or exceptional conditions that occur during program execution and can be handled or propagated to higher levels, while syntax errors are mistakes in the code's syntax that prevent the program from being executed at all."
